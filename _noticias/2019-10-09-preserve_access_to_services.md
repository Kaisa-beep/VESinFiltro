Venezuela Inteligente and the VE sin Filtro project, together with over 27 Venezuelan and international organizations, urge tech companies in a joint letter to preserve access to their online platforms and services for Venezuelans. In response to some tech companies' overblown reaction to US Executive Order 13884.

"Online services are critical for every day lives of millions of Venezuelans, for their work, education and the exercise of their rights online," said Andrés Azpúrua, director of the VE sin Filtro Project and Vice-president of the Internet Society Venezuelan Chapter. <br>
"Unnecessary and overzealous measures like blocking all Venezuelan accounts create even more harm to Venezuelans that already struggle to be productive, stay informed and express themselves freely" he added.

<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"> Letter to tech companies: <b>Preserve access to services and platforms for Venezuelans</b></h2>


Accessing the Internet and online services are essential lifelines for
Venezuelans living in a political and economic crisis. Recently, some
tech companies have tragically decided to unnecessarily drop all
Venezuelan clients in response to US President Trump\'s [Executive
Order
13884](https://www.state.gov/venezuela-related-sanctions/);
which is intended to block support to the Government of Nicolas Maduro
in Venezuela and related sanctioned individuals.

The order, however, **doesn\'t call for an outright ban of services to
Venezuelans**, only to the Government of Venezuela and sanctioned
individuals. If more tech companies decide to follow with similarly
overzealous actions, **the [already vulnerable
Venezuelans](https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24788&LangID=E)
stand to lose their capacity to work or effectively exercise their
rights online.**

Internet domains provider Sedo.com LLC, creative platforms and software
firm Adobe Inc, and online money transfer service TransferWise Ltd have
[decided to close venezuelan accounts at
large](https://helpx.adobe.com/la/x-productkb/policy-pricing/executive-order-venezuela.html);
**collaterally** **affecting their many honest and hard working clients
that depend on their software and services and are not targeted by the
Executive Order**. Hosting platform Heroku similarly had blocked the
creation of new accounts from Venezuela but seem to be registering new
ones again, we applaud Heroku\'s reversal.

**Accessing the Internet and online services is critical** for
everything from [getting independent
news](https://time.com/5571504/venezuela-internet-press-freedom/),
[exercising freedom of
speech](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2018/venezuela)
and being [productive during the current
crisis](https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2019/04/14/electronic-nomads-the-life-of-a-venezuelan-freelancer/),
especially when the internet is being [heavily
censored](https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/la_censura_no_se_detiene_por_visita_de_bachelet/)
and users and organizations are [under state-sponsored
attacks](https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/Phishing_by_Venezuelan_government_targets_activists/).
Outright banning Venezelan users from important services will create
more harm and limit their own agency in the last free medium Venezuelans
still have access to.

**We urge tech companies to preserve access to their services to
Venezuelan users. Complying with regulations in ways that help protect
the rights of Venezuelans**, which are already threatened at home,
instead of further endangering them.
