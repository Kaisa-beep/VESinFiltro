The state-owned ISP in venezuela has blocked the website of [Acceso a la justicia](https://www.accesoalajusticia.org/), a human rights NGO specialized in monitoring the administration of justice and the rule of law in Venezuela.

**This block, which began this April 8 2021, prevents customers of CANTV (Venezuela's main Internet provider and a state-owned company) from accessing to [accesoalajusticia.org](https://accesoalajusticia.org)**. CANTV is the Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Venezuela [that blocks the most websites](https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/twitter_youtube_instagram_2019-01/), having also collaborated in massive [phishing attacks](https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/Phishing_impulsado_por_gobierno_de_Venezuela/) targeting opponents of Nicolas Maduro's government.

This HTTP/HTTPS blocking implemented by CANTV requires the use of a VPN to bypass the censorship, as other common techniques would be ineffective. This is not the first attempt to silence Acceso a la Justicia's website. On April 2020 their site was taken down after their hosting service provider received false and malicious DMCA complaints made with the intention of making them loose their web hosting and taking down their site. However these allegations were eventually discredited after pressuring the hosting provider with the help of VE Sin Filtro.

This block is another serious attack against human rights in Venezuela. It limits the right to freedom of speech and information, the freedom of association in a context of extensive censorship of the press [online](https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/venezuela_bloquea_las_noticias-2019-05/) and [offline](http://espaciopublico.ong/marzo-censura-intimidacion-y-restricciones-a-la-libertad-de-expresion/), as well as [threats](https://runrun.es/noticias/440668/director-de-fundaredes-pedira-proteccion-a-la-onu-y-cidh-tras-amenazas-de-cabello/) and [persecution](https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2020/12/21/venezuela-ataques-contra-organizaciones-humanitarias)  to civil society organizations. Freedom House in its 2020 Freedom On The Net report classifies Venezuela's internet as ‚Äú[not free](https://freedomhouse.org/country/venezuela/freedom-net/2020)‚Äù.

Despite the increasing rise of censorship and cyber attacks since 2019, accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Nicol√°s Maduro has announced its plans to legislate [the regulation of social media.  ](https://www.elimpulso.com/2021/03/04/asamblea-nacional-chavista-incluira-a-las-redes-sociales-en-la-cuestionada-ley-resorte/) Also, alongside the resurgence of a dangerous [ Cyberspace Law that was leaked in 2019](https://vesinfiltro.com/noticias/comunicado_ley_ciberespacio/), both could give legal sustenance to the destruction of online freedoms for Venezuelans.




## About this block
